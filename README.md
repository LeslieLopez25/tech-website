<h2>A website created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This website created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to show the and close the navbar. I created this following the tutorial of Brian Design. I added a background color change to the service cards' buttons as well as fixed an issue with the main image being too close to the services section main headline. And the main image has also been changed and added a hover effect of the footer links changing color and added an auto update for the copyright date. Screenshot of the website.</p>
